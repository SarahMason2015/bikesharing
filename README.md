**<h1>A Bike Share Proposal, From NYC to Des Moines, IA</h1>**

<h2>Overview </h2>

<p> When you are in an unfamiliar city, or looking for transportation in your own city, a ride share program can be very beneficial. If you’re looking to simply get from one place to another, something with 4-wheels might be the best option. However, if you like to immerse yourself in the local culture and go with the flow, 2-wheels might be for you!

<p> After a trip to New York City, my friend Kate and I realized how much fun we had using NYC’s bike share, citibike. We were able to conveniently navigate the city and see so much at our pace.  Now that we’ve made it back to Des Moines, IA, we see a need for our own community. We believe a bike share would be great here! However, NYC is quite different from Des Moines, so first we analyzed the public data from NYC’s citibike. Relevant data has been put into visualization using Tableau. This will help us to present the information and try to convince investors that Des Moines, IA needs a bike share program.

<h2>Results </h2>

<p>The results are overwhelming, but here are visualizations to help answer many questions about citibike in NYC. As you can see below, in NYC the number of tourists using citibike is well outnumbered by locals using it on their daily commutes. 
  
The interactive visualizations can be found here, in my Tableau Dashboard:

<p>These images visualize the usage of bikes by gender, user type and times of day, and day of week. Customers are more commonly your tourists or locals who don’t use the bikes often. Subscribers use the bikes more frequently, and most likely make up the population us uses the bikes for their daily commute.

<p>As show in the heatmap, males dominate the use of citibike in NYC. Here’s a much more simplistic viz. The first shows all users but the second shows by gender as well as unknown. Something else we see in this is that the user, on average, spends less than 60 minutes on the bike.

  
 ![StartEnd](https://github.com/SarahMason2015/bikesharing/blob/19311c8b496d4271edc40c9505b68d1920b3e79b/StartEnd.png)
<p>One might think this viz shows you just Start and End Points, but it shows you a lot more. For example:

-Where are the highest concentration points?
  
-What bikes are used the most?
  
-What stations will need servicing more often?

  
![usage](https://github.com/SarahMason2015/bikesharing/blob/19311c8b496d4271edc40c9505b68d1920b3e79b/Usage.png)

  
<p>This a sample of individual bikes showing their usage. The more a bike is used, it will need to be services more often. The less it’s used, the longer between service calls. Bike ID: 38404 has been used 344 times compared to the 70 times for Bike ID: 25366

<h2>Summary </h2>

<p> New York City has roughly 8.5 million residents as well has millions of tourists that visit each year. Des Moines, IA is pushing about 750 thousand residents with several million tourists yearly. By sheer population standards there is no comparison. What works for NYC will not work in Des Moines. They are two different cities, with different populations, infrastructure, things-to-do, and so much more. This doesn’t mean a bike share won’t work in Des Moines, it just means it must be done differently. Tailored to fit our needs. 

<p>All the information presented shows how it works in NYC. The idea isn’t enough to get this project off the ground, it is just the beginning. If the idea passes, the next steps will be to show how it will fit specifically in Des Moines. Ideally, this information should be presented in the initial proposal. So much more data to be gathered!
